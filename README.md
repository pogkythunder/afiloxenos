# afiloxenos
Fight xenomania! Terminal utility to learn Computer related terms in your native language.

# Why afiloxenos
In most languages today English is the lingua franca for every field, including computers. Generally speaking, the Greek term for that is xeno-mania, a mania with anything foreign. We reject this slippery slope, thus becoming unhospitable: afiloxenos. With this simple script, a small message 
containing an English term and its translation to your language will pop up every time you open your terminal:
